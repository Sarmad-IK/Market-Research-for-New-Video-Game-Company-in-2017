**Introduction and Motivation:**
Market research is extremely important, especially for any aspiring market entrant be it a startup, or an established company venturing into a new product/market. Releasing a new product is an extremely risky business, for example data shows that there is almost 95% of new products end up failing. Thus it is extremely important to understand the market which any industry is entering, and market research encompasses everything from market sizing and competitor analysis to yearly trends. For our project, we conducted the preliminary market research for a startup which is aiming to enter the video game industry, and wants to understand what platform, genre, and region would maximize its revenue. For this purpose, we will use a publicly available dataset that looks at every single video game that has sold >100,000 copies released between 1977 (when the first home video game was released) and 2016.
Our goal is helping our startup client to analyze the sales of video games to see various trends related to video game genre, publisher, platform, and release year across different regions (North America, Japan, and rest of the world). We will benchmark our data analysis on a challenging large-scale dataset which allows us to explore the varying trends in consumer preferences in the > 200 billion USD global video game industry, and provide advice for a startup company aiming to enter the market in 2017.
(Note: Our dataset is from 1977 to 2016. Even though it is not an updated dataset, there are still many insights for us to explore. So within this project only, we pretend that the current time is 2016 and help our client forecast the future video game market in 2017.)
By diving deep into the dataset, we discovered various trends and correlations among game genres, publishers, platforms, release years, sales, etc., across different regions (Europe, North America, Japan, and the rest of the world). We integrated these findings and came to specific conclusions on how to release new games in North America and Japan.
**Summary Report**
This research identified different trends the video games market has gone through over the years. In order to enter the highly competitive market globally and in North America , a company must focus on the ‘Shooter’ genre on the PS4 since it has the highest average sales per title, and is projected to have the highest market share in the coming years. However, if the entrant wishes to focus on the Japanese Market, they should work on a ‘Role Playing Game’ on the Nintendo DS. However, it might be better to focus on the NA market as it has the highest share of video games sales globally.
